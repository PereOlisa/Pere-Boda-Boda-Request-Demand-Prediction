Business Problem

Ola Bikes are suffering losses and losing out from their competition due to their inability to fulfil the ride requests of many users. To tackle this problem you are asked to predict demand for rides in a certain region and a given future time window. This would help them allocate drivers more intelligently to meet the ride requests from users.
